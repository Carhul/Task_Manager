### Introduction & Project Goals ###

Task Manager is a simple way to keep a comprehensive overview of the workload. It`s divided into different departments, but all departments can see all tasks on every department and also create a new task on the appropriate department.

The Project Goal is to make the days at the office more easy and transparent across the different departments. 

This is the third of four Milestone Projects the student needs to complite, to achieve the Diploma in Software Development.

The main requirements on this project was to build a full-stack website, where users could manage a common dataset, using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Flask and MongoDB.
