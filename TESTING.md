### Testing User Stories ###

* As a general user, I want to:

  * Se a simple application with calm colours without a lot of distractions

    When enter the application, the user meets a background image of coffee-beans, and harmonious colors on the navbar, main content and footer. There are no unnecessary or disturbing elements. The color palette follows throughout the application. 

  * Se the workload accross the departments

    The workload is showing immediately when the user enters the page

  * Se who made the task

    The user can se who made the task, by clicking on the prefered task. A dropdown with the desired information will show. 

  * Have the opportunity to Sign Up, for accsess to more features

    The user can easily Sign Up by pushing the Sign Up button in the navbar.

* As a logged in user, in addition to the general above, I want to:

  * Be able to create tasks on the department of my own choice

    The user can easily create own tasks by pushing the Create Task in navbar. This is now available as a signed in user. 

  * Edit and delete tasks created by me

    The user can do this from the main page, All Tasks - or in the profile page. In the profile page is only the tasks created by the logged in user visible. This would be the preferred method in case where there is a lot of tasks.
